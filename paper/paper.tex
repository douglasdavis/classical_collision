\begin{abstract}
  This report describes a computational study of two body collisions where the dynamics of the bodies are governed by a Hooke's Law type force at the interaction points. We investigate a number of scenarios which involve a stationary target object which is contacted by a projectile object with some horizontal velocity in a two dimensional plane. Object trajectories are determined from a simulation software package, along with other various kinematic variables. Parameters governing the interactions and the kinematics are changed to study various trends in the kinematic variables for different scenarios.
